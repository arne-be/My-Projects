function [M,S]=rigidfactorization_ortho(Zc,epsilon,n_iter)
% Rigid Factorization. The steps are:
% 1. Factorize Z_c using any factorization
% 2. project R into the manifold of motion matrices
% 3. recalculate shape with S^k = {M^k}^\daga Z_c
% 4. recalculate R as Z_c {S_k}^\daga
% 5. if ||M_k - M_{k-1} || < \epsilon finish
% 6. M=M_k S=S_k
% INPUT:
% Zc: 2D tracking data from a monocular video [2F x P], where F is the
% number of frames "n_frames" and P is the number of points "n_points"
% OUTPUT:
% M [2F x 3] camera rotation matrix per frame f
% S [3 x P] rigid shape
% 

if nargin < 2
    epsilon=0.05;

% Removing translation component as the mean values of Zc
T = mean(Zc,2);
Zc = Zc - repmat(T,1,size(Zc,2));

    % You need the motion "R" and shape ""S"" factors without assuming the corrective
    % matrix Q (this step is provided later)
%getting the SVD
[U,D,Vt] = svd(Zc);
%enforcing the rank
U_r = U(:, 1:3);
D_r = D(1:3, 1:3);
Vt_r = Vt(1:3, :);
%getting the final vlaues
R = U_r * sqrt(D_r);
S = sqrt(D_r) * Vt_r;
